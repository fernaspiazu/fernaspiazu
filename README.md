# Hi 👋

My name is Fernando, I'm a Software Engineer with a passion for functional programming in particular using <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/" rel="nofollow">Scala</a> language (even if it seems is dying :broken_heart:). 

I like to work in the **back-end** side, but also topics like Data Engineering (former BigData?), Reactive apps and System Architectures :muscle:

- 📫 You can reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aspiazu/)
- 🌱 I'm eager to learn more about Data Engineering/Architectures and anything the current context requires :wink:
- 🛠️ I'm also curious in modern architectures running on the Cloud.
