# Hi 👋

My name is Fernando, I'm a Software Engineer with a passion for functional programming in particular using <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/" rel="nofollow">Scala</a> language (even if it seems is dying :broken_heart:). 

I like the back-end side and topics like Data Engineering, Reactive apps and System Architectures as well :muscle:

But I'm really bad to craft CSS or any other front-end-related stuff, sorry :pray:

- 📫 You can reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aspiazu/)
- 🌱 I'm eager to learn more about Data Engineering, Data Architectures and anything the current context requires.
- 🛠️ I'm also curious in modern architectures running on the Cloud.
